# Courses

This page contains the course material. For more information about our schedule and upcoming trainings, please follow our [even calendar](https://supercomputing.lu/events).

Courses are primarily designed to be completed in just one day. This format is considered a more effective way of learning than spreading the training over multiple days. The one-day training consists of three stages:

- __Preparation:__ Pre-preparation to follow up on the lecture and practicals
- __Lecture:__ Introduction and focus on the course topic
- __Practicals:__ Hands-on session
