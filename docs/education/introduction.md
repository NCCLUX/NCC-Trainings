If you are an educator and would like to provide a course, please read the following instructions:

The following are the website and git repository for providing the training events under EuroCC (Luxembourg).

https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings <br /> 
https://github.com/NCCLUX/NCC-Trainings

Please create your own repository and keep your training material there.
We will merge with the main branch (or publish your training material)
close to the event or earlier (whenever you are ready).

We plan to keep 2 hours for theory and 2 hours for practical (hands-on) exercise.
Typically, the entire event is for 5 hours; this extra 1 hour is dedicated
to a dry-run (to ensure registered participants can access the
machine (in this case, MeluXina) and test the training material (hands-on exercise) already.
For example,
```
11:00-12:00 (dry-run),
12:00-13:00 (lunch break),
13:00-15:00 (lecture) and
15:00-17:00 (hands-on exercise).
```
It would be nice to have a categorisation for the hands-on exercise,
for example, going from basic to intermediate topics (or advanced).
The previous course examples are here: https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings/cuda/exercise-1/

Example case: The Quantum Expresso course comes under Computational Chemistry (if you have another name preference, please let us know).
Before the event (for the event advertisement), we need to publish the introduction and learning outcome of the course; perhaps, you could take inspiration from this existing course; https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings/openmp/

Could you please provide a suitable date (because we also need to reserve the HPC machine for the event) as soon as possible, and at the same time, we also need to publish (Luxinnovation handles the landing page information) the event info.
at least 3-4 weeks before so that enough participants would be able to register for the event.

For the training event, we usually accept 20-30 (however, as you might have known already,
in an event like this, some participants would not attend the event at the last minute.
Therefore, we usually accept around 50. Usually, the participants come from Luxembourg (academic and industry) and other EU countries as well. However, preference will be given to Luxembourg participants. More importantly, these events are online (mainly giving participants flexibility and avoiding local logistics burden).

During the event, you will be using the MeluXina HPC machine once you have come up with the date for the event. We can request your account in MeluXina for the training material preparation. Regarding the participants, MeluXina access will be given before the event.
