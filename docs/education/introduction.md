The following are the website and Git repository for hosting the training events under EuroCC (Luxembourg).

https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings <br /> 
https://github.com/NCCLUX/NCC-Trainings

Please create your own repository and store your training materials there. We will merge with the main branch (or publish your training materials) close to the event or earlier, whenever you are ready.

We plan to allocate 2 hours for theory and 2 hours for practical (hands-on) exercises. Typically, the entire event lasts 5 hours; this extra 1 hour is dedicated to a dry-run to ensure registered participants can access the machine (in this case, MeluXina) and test the training materials (hands-on exercises) in advance.
For example,
```
11:00-12:00 (dry-run),
12:00-13:00 (lunch break),
13:00-15:00 (lecture) and
15:00-17:00 (hands-on exercise).
```
It would be helpful to categorize the hands-on exercises, for example, from basic to intermediate (or advanced) topics. Previous course examples are available here: https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings/cuda/exercise-1/

For example, the Quantum Espresso course falls under Computational Chemistry (if you prefer another name, please let us know). Before the event, for promotional purposes, we need to publish the course introduction and learning outcomes. You might draw inspiration from this existing course: https://ncclux.github.io/NCC-Trainings/openmp/

Could you please provide a suitable date as soon as possible (as we need to reserve the HPC machine for the event)? We also need to publish the event info (Luxinnovation handles the landing page) at least 3-4 weeks before the event so that enough participants can register.

For the training event, we usually accept 20-30 participants. However, as you might know, in events like this, some participants may not attend at the last minute. Therefore, we usually accept around 50 registrants. Participants typically come from Luxembourg (academic and industry sectors) and other EU countries. However, preference will be given to Luxembourg participants. Importantly, these events are primarily online, offering participants flexibility and avoiding local logistical burdens.

During the event, you will be using the MeluXina HPC machine. Once you confirm the date for the event, we can request your account on MeluXina for training material preparation. Regarding participants, access to MeluXina will be granted before the event.
