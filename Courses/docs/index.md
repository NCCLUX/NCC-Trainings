## MeluXina: open for commercial use


<p align="center"><img src="figures/meluxina.jpeg" width="900px"/></p>

Inaugurated recently in June 2021, MeluXina is open for commercial use. It has received top marks by ranking organisation TOP500, which places it 1st in the EU and 4th in the world for its energy efficiency.

Unlike most HPC systems that are pure research infrastructures, 65% of MeluXina’s capacity is available for start-ups, SMEs and large companies. The system has been built on an efficient platform and is meant to serve a large variety of complex, data-driven computational workloads. Based on the Modular Supercomputing Architecture, its forward-looking design responds to the convergence of simulation, modelling, data analytics and artificial intelligence, and enables simulation driven by predictive analytics.



## HPC Thursdays webinar series

<p align="center"><img src="figures/hpc_thursday.jpg" width="900px"/></p>


The “HPC Thursdays” webinar series provides an understanding of the benefits of using a supercomputer. It also looks at what a supercomputer is, how it works, and the skills needed to use one. Each webinar presents concrete examples of applications in different domains to help participants understand the value added of using a supercomputer, and to inspire future users in order to boost their innovation activities.

The HPC Thursdays webinars are designed for newcomers in the supercomputing world, from all sectors of industry and all disciplines of research as well as from public administration. This is the perfect exploratory path to understand the basics of HPC.
