#### Shared variable

 - All the threads have access to the shared variable.
 - By default in the parallel region, all the variables are
 considered as a shared variable expect the loop iteration
 counter variables.

!!! Note

	Shared variables should be handled carefully; otherwise it causes race conditions in the program.

        ```

??? info "Question"

     - Does the value of vector `a` change after the parallel loop, if not why, think?
     - Do we really need to mention `shared(a)`, is it neccessary? 

#### Private variable

 - Each thread will have its own copy of the private variable.
 - And the private variable is only accessible within the parallel region,
 not outside of the parallel region.
 - By default, the loop iteration counters are considered as a private.
 - A change made by one thread is not visible to other threads.

     - What is the value of the varible `a` in the parallel region and after the parallel region?
     - After the parallel region, does variable `a` has been updated or not? 


#### Lastprivate

 - lastprivate: is also similar to a private clause
 - But each thread will have an uninitialized copy of the variables passed
 as lastprivate
 - At the end of the parallel loop or sections, the final variable value will
 be the last thread accessed value in the section or in a parallel loop.

#### Firstprivate

 - firstprivate: is similar to a private clause
 - But each thread will have an initialized copy of the variables passed
 as firstprivate
 - Available for parallel constructs, loop, sections and single
 constructs
