Profiling is an essential procedure to make sure you are utilising the given architecture with a given algorithm. Sometimes, we might think we are doing efficient computation. However, it will not always be the case unless we do the proper profiling and check if all the resources are utilized properly. 

Using Nvidia HPC SDK, we could profile our OpenACC code. We could do the profiling in two ways: Command line and GUI.

####<u>Command Line</u>

   - **`export NVCOMPILER_ACC_TIME=[]`**
     - [1]: kernel launches
     - [2]: data transfers
     - [4]: region entry/exit
     - [8]: wait for operations or synchronizations
     - [16]: device memory allocates and deallocates

Setting **`export NVCOMPILER_ACC_NOTIFY=3`** provides kernel executions and data transfer information.

        ```


####<u>[GUI](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html)</u>
The Visual Profiler is organized into views. Together, the views allow you to analyze and visualize the performance of your application. 
The Timeline View shows CPU and GPU activity that occurred while your application was being profiled. 
Multiple timelines can be opened in the Visual Profiler at the same time in different tabs. The following figure shows a Timeline View for a OpenACC application.

In order to visualize the performance of your application, you should connect to the HPC machine via -X forward; 
otherwise, you will not be able to see the GUI application. For example, on MeluXina, you should do the following.

!!! Info "GUI login"
    ```c
    $ ssh -X meluxina
    
    $ salloc -A p200117 --partition=gpu --qos test -N 1 -t 00:30:00 srun --forward-x --pty bash -l
    ```

We also need to add a few extra modules to open a GUI application. 
On MeluXina, we need to add the following modules: 


!!! Info "Required modules"

    ```c
    module load NVHPC/22.7
    module load CUDA/11.7.0
    module load Mesa/22.0.3-GCCcore-11.3.0		
    module load Qt5/5.15.5-GCCcore-11.3.0
    ```
    
Once the required modules are loaded, you can compile your application and visualize the performance of your application. 
Finally, we need use command line **`nsys-ui`** to open GUI application and load **`timeline.nsys-rep`**. 

!!! Info "Compilation and GUI"
        ```
